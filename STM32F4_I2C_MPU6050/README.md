Whole project is developed by using Atollic IDE and gcc compiler on Linux. However, same code will work with other IDEs and compilers like Keil and ARM compiler.
This project demonstrates how I2C peripheral deriver is developed without neither HAL nor any third party library.

Main idea is how to use I2C with SFRs if you have any question about calculation of Euler angles, you can check my blog (ozgurayik.com). There is a content for this,
it is not in english but chrome translator works well on it.
