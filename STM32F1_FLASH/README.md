Although most of ST microcontollers have enough peripherals, They are lack of EEPROM. If you need a nonvolatile memory for your project and you dont plan to 
do write operation to this memory too much(this will finish your flash memory's life cycle), you can use your flash memory to store these datas.

This example shows how to write and read data to flash memory. Please be aware of flash memories limited life cycle in terms of write operation.
